          My name is Ibrahim (well you know that), writing regarding the Orchard residency program at Apple Marcom. I am a recent graduate of ArtCenter College of Design,
          with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and a specialization in motion graphics. I find myself regularly revisiting your words of wisdom during
          our mentoring conversations; as well as the <em>Camo Collection</em> project you worked on at Stink Studios.

          While attending a bookbinding class after school, I was speaking with the teacher’s assistant about advice moving forward. I’d heard a lot of noise
          about the intensity of ArtCenter’s workload and the expectations for great outcomes. She noted not to let my style dictate the outcome—rather the
          intention of the work should dictate the style. This advice aligned seamlessly with your advice to me early-on: Focus not on being a specific designer, rather being
          a “lowercase ‘d’ designer”. To ignore the fanfare around seeking titles, and instead pursuing the skills those titles hold. Essentially becoming the Avatar of all designers—an exciting proposition.

          The integrity of both of these advices have been instilled into each of my projects. My proudest work, <em>Sorrow</em>, depicts the story of a girl in the country’s poorest congressional district represented by the Mater Dolorosa; and her journey through the socioeconomic claustrophobia of transferring to a new school. My execution reveals the visceral anxiety Melanie feels as she walks the halls of Fieldston—then relief, through reflection and over time. At school,  I onboarded each department’s focus into this project. From direction to color.
